# ReadMe for elevator project spring 2020

## Using the simulator

To run a new elevator type in the following:

Choose a 5 digit connection port, i.e. 12345.

In the terminal running the program:
go run -ldflags="-X main.TCP_ConnectionPort=12345" main.go

In terminal running the simulator:

./SimElevatorServer --port 12345




## Description of the modules:

### stateMachine:
The stateMachine module is in charge of running one elevator according to the description. It has four triggers: Button pushed, floor detected, order received and timeOut.

Button pushed:

When a button is pushed on the elevator, a message with the respective order is sent on the channel "orders_to_order_handler". The order handler then distributes the order to the right elevator.

Floor detected:

When the floor sensor detects a new floor, a message with the floor number is sent on the channel "drv_floors". The state machine then saves the previous floor in a variable and then updates the elevator object to contain the floor detected. The floor indicator light is also turned on on the floor detected.

If we have arrived at a new floor we shall do the following:
If we are meant to stop on the floor, we stop the elevator and executes the orders.
Since we now are at a new floor, the elevator object has now changed, and we send a message on the status update channel.

Order received:

An order is received from the order handler on the channel "incoming_orders". We should then add the order to our execution list, and set the light in the correct order button. If we are in Idle, we should execute the order immediately.

### control
The control module has responsibility over the local elevator. 

Here the elevator structure is made and constant elevator variables are declared, more specific number of buttons and number og floors.

The module also contains elevator-specific functions. That is init functions and an functions that updates the atributes of the elevator object.

### orderHandler
The orderHandler module distributes all orders created by, or assigned to the local elevator. It also manages the list of orders in the local elevator.

Whenever a button is pushed on the local elevator, the order is sent to the orderHandler, which decides wether the order can be taken directly (cab order) or needs to be distributed (hall orders). 

If the order can be taken directly, the order is added to the local order list and the correct lights are turned on. On the other hand, if the order is to be distributed it is sent to the orderDistributer module.

If an order has been assigned to the local elevator, it is sent from the order distributer to the order handler. The order then adds the order to the order list and turns on the correct lights.

If an order has been executed, the fsm will send a boolean signal (true) to the message handler, and by that saying: "The orders on the current floor are executed". The order handler then removes all orders on the current floor from the order list.
