# Network

Note: this module has a help-function module containing lower-level help functions. This is done to try and improve qode quality.

## Module description
This module is in charge of broadcasting and receiving messages using UDP. There are three types of messages that are sent:

### Status updates
Type: Elev (see elevator module)

Port: 2000

All status updates are broadcasted to the port stated. This port is unique and only used for status updates. The network module broadcasts all status-messages sent to the channel ch_bcast_stat_update. All status-messages that are broadcasted to the port stated, are sent to the channel ch_rec_stat_update.

### Orders
Type: ExtOrder (see orderDistributer module)

Port: 20203

All orders are broadcasted to the port stated. This port is unique and only used for order-messages. The network module broadcasts all order-messages sent to the channel ch_bcast_order. All order-messages that are broadcasted to the port stated, are sent to the channel ch_rec_ext_order.

### Order Updates
Type: int

Port: 20194

All order updates are broadcasted to the port stated. This port is unique and only used for order updates. In this project, an order update states at which floor an order has been executed. Whenever an order has been executed at a floor, corresponding int is sent to the network module via the channel ch_bcast_order_exec. All order updates sent to this channel are directly broadcasted to the port stated.

All messages sent to the port stated, are directly sent to the order distributer via the channel chan_rec_order_exec.
